# AskClassroom - Product Details

## What is AskClassroom?
AskClassroom is a modern, interactive AI-powered educational platform built with Next.js. It allows users to engage in real-time voice conversations with AI "Companions" (tutors) specialized in various subjects and topics. The platform aims to simulate a one-on-one tutoring experience through voice interactions and real-time visual feedback.

## How we are working (Architecture & Tech Stack)
The application is built using a robust, modern web development stack:
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router) with React 19.
- **Styling & UI:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, lucide-react icons, and Framer Motion for sleek animations.
- **Voice AI Integration:** Powered by `vapi-ai` for low-latency, real-time voice conversations with the AI.
- **Authentication:** Secured user authentication and management using Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs`).
- **Database / Backend:** Supabase is utilized for backend data storage and management (sessions, user data).
- **Form Handling:** `react-hook-form` paired with `zod` for schema validation.
- **Rich Text & Math:** Integration with `react-markdown` and `katex` for rendering complex mathematical equations and formatted text.
- **Observability:** Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) is integrated for error tracking and performance monitoring.

## Core Features

### 1. AI Voice Companions
- **Real-time Voice Chat:** Users can use their microphone to speak directly to AI companions and hear responses in real-time.
- **Subject-Specific Tutors:** Companions are tailored to specific subjects and topics, each with custom visual avatars and colors.
- **Session History:** Completed sessions are saved and displayed on the dashboard for users to review their journey.

### 2. Interactive Whiteboard Animation
- **Real-Time Word Sync:** As the AI speaks, words dynamically appear on a "whiteboard" UI.
- **Live vs. Completed Sentences:** The UI differentiates between the currently spoken sentence (live words) and previously completed sentences.
- **Audio Visualizers:** Lottie-based soundwave animations give visual feedback when the AI is speaking.

### 3. Live Transcript
- In addition to the whiteboard, a classic chat transcript is maintained during the call, distinguishing between user and assistant messages for easy reading.

### 4. Companion Discovery & filtering
- **Search & Filter:** Users can search for specific companions or filter them by subject using dedicated UI components (`SearchInput.tsx`, `SubjectFilter.tsx`).
- **Recent Sessions:** Quick access to recently interacted companions on the home page.

### 5. Monetization & Access
- **Subscription Model:** The platform includes a dedicated subscription flow/route, likely for premium AI features or unlimited usage times.

### 6. User Journey Tracking
- A dedicated "My Journey" section allows users to track their learning progress and past interactions.
